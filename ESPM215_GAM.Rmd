```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Potential datasets
```{r}
ISIT <- read.delim('ISIT.txt')
RK <- read.delim('RoadKills.txt')
head(ISIT)
head(RK)
```


## LOESS Span Sizes

## GAM with single explanatory variable - go through output

## Create graph similar to Fig. 3.11 (Zuur et al. 2009) of lambda vs GCV, compare with automatic GCV

## Comparison of GLM, GAM, GAMM using AIC, GCV, analysis of deviance, power analysis?
- multiple explanatory variables, interactions?
